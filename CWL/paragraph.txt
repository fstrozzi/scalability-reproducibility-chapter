Common workflow language (CWL) is a standard for describing portable
workflows that are portable across a variety of computing platforms[1]. CWL is
therefore a specification and not a specific piece of software. Given that CWL
has its foundation from previously developed tools and Make in particular, the order of
execution in a CWL workflow is based on dependencies between the required
tasks[2].

In describing a CWL standard, the inputs, the outputs and the software tools are
explicitly described. This description makes the workflow tasks flexible and 
scalable depending on the requirements of the implementation engine and the
computing enviroment.

CWL workflows are written in JSON or YAML ,or a combination of the two. A
workflow comprise of 'steps'. Each step in turn is made up of 
a task description that includes the inputs and outputs of the task.
The order of executing the tasks is determined automatically by
the implementation engine.

Here we demostrate an example CWL workflow to easily run an analysis for a group of
proteins whilst reducing the computing time and enabling reproducibility by
taking advantage of docker.
